# Analysis of the code

- There has been an attempt to separate display code (printing things) from the game logic, which is nice. But you didn't go all the way (i.e. initializing the game and printing the rules is mixed up, and the scoreboard also directly prints itself to the screen)
- The fact that Entities are Enums is nice, but a lot of the code is directly coupled to the integer values of the Enums.
- I'm not sure why there is a self.entities that refers to the enum type. It unnecessarily complicates things.
- Game initialization code contains too many different things: printing the rules, creating objects, registering the players, etc. It's better to keep the initializer relatively simple and do those things elsewhere so it gives you more control.
- Rules doesn't need to be a class and the data structure used to represent the rules contains redundancy (the winner is always the first element in the tuple, and the message contains the string values of the entities)
- The Game logic directly modifies the score board, which violates the Law of Demeter.
- It's no longer needed to import things like Tuple and Dict from typing.
- Naming could be improved: player instead of user, method names like 'get_user_input' and the Game instance variable 'user' are too vague

# Code refactoring

- Create a UI protocol and CLI implementation
- Remove the string code from the Scoreboard and move it to CLI
- Remove the printing code from the Game initializer and put it in CLI. Remove the rest of the printing code as well

- Simplify the rules file to remove the redundancy
- Turn Game into a dataclass and inject Scoreboard and the UI
- Rewrite the turn and play methods in Game to use the Scoreboard and UI
