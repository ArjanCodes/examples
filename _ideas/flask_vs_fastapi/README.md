## Fast API

- Very easy API development with lots of useful features
- Directly integrates with Pydantic for input and output validation
- No integration with something like SQLAlchemy or other ORMs

## Flask

- Not specifically built for API development but for web servers in general
- There's Flask_sqlalchemy with makes integration with SQLAlchemy easier
- By integrating everything, writing code in a layered architecture is really hard
