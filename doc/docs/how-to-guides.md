## How To Add Two Numbers?

You have two numbers and you need to add them together.
You're in luck! The `calculator` package can help you
get this done.

Download the code from this GitHub repository and place
the `calculator/` folder in the same directory as your
Python script:

    your_project/
    │
    ├── calculator/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── calculations.py
    │
    └── your_script.py

Inside of `your_script.py` you can now import the
`add()` function from the `calculator.calculations`
module:

    # your_script.py
    from calculator.calculations import add

After you've imported the function, you can use it
to add any two numbers that you need to add:

    # your_script.py
    from calculator.calculations import add

    print(add(20, 22))  # OUTPUT: 42.0

You're now able to add any two numbers, and you'll
always get a `float` as a result.
