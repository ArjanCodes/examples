## Intro

## What is property-based testing?

## Different types of property-based testing

1. IF you have a reversible operation (like encoding and then decoding a string), you can test that the operation and then the reversed operation result in the same value.

2. If you know that after calling a function, a certain property should hold, you can write tests to verify that as well.
