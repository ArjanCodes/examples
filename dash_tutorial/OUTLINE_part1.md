# Dash video tutorial Part 1

In this new video series, I'm going to show you how to create a dashboard to view data and perform a couple of simple operations like filtering and selecting. The tool I'll be using for this is Dash, which integrates nicely with Plotly and I'll do some basic processing using Pandas DataFrames. The key things that I want to show you in this tutorial series is that software design principles like reducing coupling and introducing abstraction are really helpful to make your code easier to change later on.

In this first part, I'm going to cover the setup of the application and show you how to create a basic user interface in which we can handle button clicks and display information.

Getting started with Dash:

- explain inputs and outputs
- explain setting up a basic application with a few components
- don't load the data yet, but just show the year, month, and category selection UI elements and how they work
