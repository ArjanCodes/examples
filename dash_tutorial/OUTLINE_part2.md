# Dash video tutorial Part 2

## Introduction

This is part 2 of a miniseries where I create a data visualization dashboard using Dash and Plotly. In the first part, I showed how to setup a basic application that displays a couple user interface elements and displays data. Now, I'm going to add some complexity by loading a custom data set, doing some processing on the data and extend the capabilities of the dashboard. It's a really fun summer project to work on an application like this, I hope you enjoy it too.

Now, let's dive right back in.
