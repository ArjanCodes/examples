## About this video

This video is about how to use the Strategy pattern where each strategy has different parameters.

## Video outline

- There's a problem with the Strategy pattern. The idea of the pattern is that you can swap out algorithms without having to change the code that uses the algorithm. For example, you could the Strategy pattern to switch between different file compressions algorithms. But what if you want to change settings specific to a particular compression algorithm? For example, zip has a compression level option, but zlib also has windowBits, chunkSize and more. I'll show three different ways to do it. But actually, only one of them is a good solution.

- Now generally, before you apply patterns such as the Strategy, it's important that you understand the problem that you're trying to solve. I wrote a 7-step guide describing my process to do that. You can get it for free at arjancodes.com/designguide. I've learned that if you invest some time into properly defining the scope of the problem you're trying to solve, and figuring out the important concepts and how they're related. This always pays off. The guide describes what I generally do to better understand a problem before I start solving it. It might help you organize your thoughts. So, arjancodes.com/designguide. Now, let's dive into today's example.

- Give an overview of the example (trading bot with different trading strategies). [screencast]

- The issue with the example is that each strategy currently has hard-coded parameters. The average trading strategy has a fixed window size. The min-max trading strategy has fixed min and max prices. Let's look at three possible ways of solving this issue.

- First solution: add \*\*kwargs to the strategy function and use that to pass parameters. This works, but a) you lose typing information since kwargs is an arbitrary dict of floats and b) not all arguments are floats so you have to do type casting to int for the window size, or use Union types, which is ugly. Unfortunately, as far as I can see you can't use a TypedDict to specify what the type of the keyword arguments are. Let's look at a second solution that offers a bit more control over the type.

- Second solution: create a StrategyParameters class that contains all the parameters. This works as well, but a) it's not clear which parameters are used for which strategies and b) you now have direct coupling between all of the different strategies since their options are amalgated into one (potentially huge) class. Ugghh. There have been some papers discussing a generic, abstract Parameters class and then having arrays of Parameter subclass instances. So you could have an IntParameter subclass, a BoolParameter subclass etc. It might solve this issue, but there is a much bigger problem here. [screencast]

- Overarching problem of the two previous solutions is that the run method in the trading bot needs to know about implementation details of particular strategies. The decoupling we wanted to achieve with the pattern is now undone again. Let's look at one more solution. And I think this is how you should do it.

- Final solution: make the parameters part of each strategy subclass, and set them in the initializer. Result: a) parameters are at the place where they're used b) they are set when the concrete strategy is created, so you don't introduce extra coupling (it's already coupled there), and c) the run method doesn't need to know anything about specific parameters. Here you also see the advantage of using a class for each strategy as opposed to just passing functions around. Being able to combine behavior with data is the power of classes. Don't be afraid to use them. [screencast]

- Conclusion: when you want to use different parameters with the strategy pattern, set them in the initializer. If you can't set the parameter values in the initializer for some reason, you could always add get and set methods to each Strategy subclass to change them. But be careful where you do that, because at that stage, you're introducing coupling. In fact, you might want to rethink your design because it points to a potential issue.
