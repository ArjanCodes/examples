# Dash video tutorial Part 1

## Introduction

If you're working a lot with data, it's useful to have your own dashboard environment where you easily view and filter your data. In this three-part miniseries I'm going to show you how to set this up using Dash and Plotly. In this first part, I'm going to show you how to create a basic user interface in which we can handle button clicks and display some data. In the secon part I'll cover integrating this with pandas DataFrames. And in the last part, I'll take the application to a whole new level by showing you what happens if you spend some time improving the software design.

This video is not sponsored by Plotly by the way. I did collaborate with Mark Todisco who came up with the idea to do a miniseries on this topic. So, thanks so much Mark for your help. We spent a lot of time on perfecting the example code, so I hope you enjoy it. The code is going to be on GitHub as always, the link is in the description.

When you setup an app like this from scratch, there are lots of things to think about. Where's the data stored, and how is this going to interact with other systems? I've written a free guide to help you get start. You can get it at arjan.codes/designguide. It describes the 7 steps I take whenever I design a new piece of software, to help you improve the software design decisions you take. So, arjan.codes/designguide.

## Screencast

- explain inputs and outputs
- explain setting up a basic application with a few components
