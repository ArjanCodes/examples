# Analysis of the current code

- Use snake case to comply with Python's PEP8 style guide
- in endscreen: no need to store winnerlabel in a member variable
- don't forget to add type hints
- the pos instance variable is actually not used anywhere, so you can remove it
- there's a lot of duplication in the piece subclasses
