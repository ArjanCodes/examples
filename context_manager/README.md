# Introduction

There's only a few managers I actually like. One of them is the seagull manager. Fly in, dump on everyone and make a big mess, and then leave. I'm still trying to perfect my moves. But that's not what this video is about. This video is about another manager I like: the context manager in Python.

I'll show you how to use them and I'll cover several ways to create your own, and I'll takl about when you should use them and when you shouldn't.

Before we dive in, I have something for you. A free guide to help you make better design decisions. You can get it at arjancodes.com/designguide. It's a PDF file, to the point, explaining the steps I take when I design a new piece of software. Hopefully, it's helpful to you. So, arjancodes.com/designguide. The link is also in the description of the video.

Now, let's dive in!

# Explain the example without context manager (screencast)

# What are context managers?

Context managers allow you to to control setup and teardown of any sort of resource in way that minimizes the chance of you forgetting to do the teardown, especially in the presence of exceptions.

If you've ever opened a file in Python, you've probably used the with statement to manage the file. This is a context manager, and it's a good way to manage resources.

```python
with open('file.txt') as f:
    f.read()
```

Let's look a bit closer at what's happening in a with statement:

```python
with EXPRESSION as VARIABLE:
    DO SOMETHING
```

This is what's happening behind the scenes:

```python
manager = (EXPRESSION)
enter = type(manager).__enter__
exit = type(manager).__exit__
value = enter(manager)
hit_except = False

try:
    VARIABLE = value
    DO SOMETHING
except:
    hit_except = True
    if not exit(manager, *sys.exc_info()):
        raise
finally:
    if not hit_except:
        exit(manager, None, None, None)
```

The SQLite connection can itself be used as a context manager, like so:

```python
with sqlite3.connect('application.db') as conn:
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM blogs")
```

The advantage here is that the connection will automatically roll back commit or rollback transactions but the connection object does not automatically close so it should be closed manually afterwards. And then we'd still have to make sure that the connection is closed in all cases (even if an exception is raised).

The nice thing about Python is that we can create our own context managers. Let's create one for the SQLite example, that automatically closes the connection for us.

# Basic usage (screencast)

- Create SQLite context manager (showing both the class and the decorator syntax)

# Context managers and async (talking head)

Context managers also support async/await syntax. If you want to learn more about async (concurrent) operations in Python, check out [this] video.

Here's a simple example of an asynchronous context manager taken from the Python documentation:

```python
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

@asynccontextmanager
async def get_connection():
    conn = await acquire_db_connection()
    try:
        yield conn
    finally:
        await release_db_connection(conn)

async def get_all_users():
    async with get_connection() as conn:
        return conn.query('SELECT ...')
```

# Context managers + async example (using aiosqlite, screencast)

# When to (not) use context managers

The main reason to use context managers is to help allocate and cleanup resources. This is helpful for example if you want to open a file, a database connection, or a network connection. If an error occurs, the context manager mechanism will automatically clean up the resource.

This also means that if you don't need to cleanup resources, there's no reason to use a context manager. Because context managers use the 'with' statement in Python, this results in an unnecessary code indentation level, and a new scope as well (because the variable is not accessible outside of the with statement). By the way, a nice trick is if you're nesting with statements, like this:

```python
with open_socket() as s:
    with open_file() as f:
        with open_database() as db:
            do_stuff(s, f, db) # ugh
```

You can write this differently, because Python allows you to create multiple resources in a single with statement. And since Python 3.10, you can use the parenthesis syntax to split them over multiple lines, like so:

```python
with (
    open_socket() as s,
    open_file() as f,
    open_database() as db
):
    do_stuff(s, f, db) # ugh
```
