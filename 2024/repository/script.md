## Introduction

Discover the Repository Pattern: Tame your unruly database with this superhero tool. Efficient, organized, and smarter than a query. Is it the hero we need or just another tech buzzword? Join us on this mystery unraveling journey!

when I design a new application, You can find it at `arjancodes.com/designguide` or by clicking the link in the description below.

## About the pattern

- The repository pattern is a design pattern than helps us separate how to store data from how we access it.
- By separating our concerns, we make our code base more modular, extensible, and maintainable.

An issue that can arise as applications grow is increasing complexity in how data is stored and accessed.
Not only can this couple the data to the application, but it can also make it difficult to change how the data is stored.
It also means that it we wish to test the application, we may have to mock the databases etc.
This can spell trouble for larger applications, as data access becomes more complex and more tightly coupled to the application.

- Explain that the repository pattern is not limited to databases, and that it can be used for many different kinds of data storage.
- Explain that this is very useful when working with APIs, and other kinds of data sources, or where you have hybrid data storage solutions.
- Explain that this can also be used to abstract away the way we access data, and can be used to create a more standardized way of accessing data.

### Ask users how they prefer to store their data.

## Repository code example

show the [before.py](http://before.py/) example

### Showing Coupling

- explain that the code that allows us to access the data is highly coupled to the way we store the data.
This is because the object we are creating is also responsible for creating the database connection, the cursor, and with managing its data within the table.
- explain that this means we can't change the way we store the data without changing the code that accesses it, and vice versa.
Also explain that if we wanted to test this code, mocking the database could be difficult depending on scale of the application.

> Show the repository.py example
NOTE: I recommend deleting the DB here, just so the output is cleaner and clearer.


## Showing separation of concerns

- Explain that this separation of concerns allows us to change and migrate the way we store data from the way we access it. This leads to a more flexible and maintainable codebase.
- Explain that this also allows us to reuse code, and create a more standardized way of accessing and interacting with data.
- This can help reduce bugs, and helps us not have to make wide sweeping changes to the codebase when we update the way we store data.
- 
> Show the post_repo.py example
- explain that due to the fact this enforces a particular style, its best adopted early on in the development of an application.
- Note that this pattern works quite nicely with query builders, as they can be used to generate the SQL queries for us, which can help us simplify how we represent more complex queries.

## Better software testing

> show the with_mock.py example
- Show how the repository pattern allows us to completely replace how we store the data, without having to change any of the code that uses said data.
- Explain that this is extremely useful when we want to test our code, as we can now mock any stored data.
Note that this also makes it compatible with various testing frameworks, such as Hypothesis, which can generate mock data for us.
- Explain that this can also help with migrations, as our usage of the data is not coupled to the way we store it.

> show mock.test.py
- Show how it simplifies unit tests as we can now test specific features of our code.

Warnings and Caveats (You *don't* have to include this section)

- explain that for smaller applications, the repo pattern may not be necessary.
- warn not to overcomplicate the implementation details when implementing the pattern
- Explain that it can cause the loss of fine-grained control, as it generalizes the way we access data.
- Explain that this can also cause some performance overhead, as we are adding another layer of abstraction.

# Wrapping Up

As you can see, the Repository pattern can be a powerful tool in growing applications.
It's power to separate business logic from the data layer helps us to build more modular and maintainable applications.
And by separating the concerns we get the added benefit of simplified testing and migrations.
