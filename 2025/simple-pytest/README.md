## Installation

In order to use the full potential of Bragir, FFmpeg is needed to be installed on the system and you need to obtain an Openai key.

### As a package
```zsh
pip install bragir
```

### Brew
**NOTE:** Currently bragir is not available on the homebrew-core repo, so you will need to tap our custom [ArjanCodes repo](https://github.com/ArjanCodes/homebrew-core)

```zsh
brew tap arjancodes/core
```

Then, you can run the following command:

```zsh
brew update && brew install bragir
```

### OpenAI

Currently, this tool relise on OpenAIs API. That means that an OpenAI api-key is crucial. See the following resource of [how to get an OpenAI api-key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=python)

### Bragir
Use pip to install Bragir
```bash
pip install bragir
```

Check if installation is complete

```
bragir --version
```
If a version is displayed, then Bragir is installed correctly.


# Usage

Bragir comes with two commands, transcribe and translate. Transcribe will always generate an file with extension `.srt`. The translate command has only been tested with SRT-files, however other files would work. However, Bragir is not intended to translate other file types  

In order to use bragir, the api key can be loaded into the session or saved in the config.ini file (Default at `~/.bragir/cli/config.ini`).

Load Openai key as an enviroment variable into current session
```
export OPENAI_KEY=<VALUE>
```

### Examples
Translate a single file to one language:

```
bragir translate <FILE_PATH> --language French
```

Translate one file to multiple languages:

```
bragir translate <FILE_PATH> --language French --language German
```

Translate files in a directory to multiple languages:

```
bragir translate <DIRECTORY_PATH> --language French --language German
```

Transcribe file:

```
bragir transcribe <FILE_PATH>
```

Transcribe files in a directory:

```
bragir transcribe <DIRECTORY_PATH>
```
