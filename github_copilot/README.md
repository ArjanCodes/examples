## About this video

This video is about GitHub Copilot. I'll basically be monkeying around with the tool and see how it works and discuss my thoughts about it.

## Video outline

### What is Github Copilot?

### Installing and using it in VSCode

### Play around with the tool

- Try a few basic functions:
  - Basic Copilot example to compute date difference
- Classes and dataclasses

  - Creating an Employee class
  - Make a dataclass version -> works!
  - Note that some of the example code is pretty bad (manager attributes in the Employee class)
  - Add an extra low quality exporter to factory example code (works!)

- Let's try to break it
  - Try stuff like "password =", "db_connection_string =", "api_key = " etc.

## My thoughts

- Impressed
- If it's based on the code that's in GitHub on average, there's going to be quality issues (see example with Employee/management)
